# Item-Be-Gone

Item-Be-Gone is a simple app that takes a scanned barcode and deletes the associated item record in Alma.

Item-Be-Gone can give a warning if the item about to be deleted is the last item attached to the bib record.

***Ideal for withdrawing parts of long journal runs or other multi-volume sets.

***For a more robust solution to withdrawing large volumes of monographs or full multi-volume sets, try [Book-Be-Gone](https://github.com/MrJeremyHobbs/Book-Be-Gone).
